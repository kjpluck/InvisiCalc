InvisiCalc
==========

An invisible calculator that lives in your clipboard.



Ever wanted to do a sum without using a calculator? Wouldn't it be great to just type out say, 4*(3+2)/9, in any application and have it replaced by the result? InvisiCalc watches the clipboard for math expressions and calculates any that it finds for you to copy and paste the result!
